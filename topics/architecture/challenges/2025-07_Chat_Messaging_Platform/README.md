# Chat/Messaging Platform Architecture Design

## Problem Statement
Design the architecture for a WhatsApp-like messaging platform that can support billions of users with features like group chats, media sharing, message delivery guarantees, and end-to-end encryption.

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **User Management**: Registration, authentication, profile management
- **One-on-One Messaging**: Direct messages between two users
- **Group Chats**: Support for groups with multiple participants (up to 256 users)
- **Media Sharing**: Images, videos, documents, voice messages
- **Message Types**: Text, emoji, stickers, location sharing
- **Message Status**: Sent, delivered, read receipts
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages encrypted between sender and receiver
- **Offline Support**: Messages delivered when users come online
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time notifications for new messages

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Support 2+ billion users worldwide
- **Performance**: Message delivery within 1 second
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Reliability**: No message loss, guaranteed delivery
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption, secure authentication
- **Global Distribution**: Low latency for users worldwide

## Design Constraints
- **Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours for complete design
- **Documentation**: Use Markdown with PlantUML or SVG diagrams
- **No Implementation**: This is a design-only challenge

## Deliverables

### 1. System Architecture Overview
- High-level system components
- Data flow diagrams
- Technology stack recommendations

### 2. Detailed Component Design
- **User Service**: Authentication, profiles, contacts
- **Message Service**: Message routing, delivery, storage
- **Group Service**: Group management, permissions
- **Media Service**: File storage, CDN integration
- **Notification Service**: Push notifications, email/SMS
- **Encryption Service**: Key management, E2E encryption

### 3. Data Design
- Database schemas (users, messages, groups, media)
- Data partitioning strategy
- Caching strategy
- Message storage and retention policies

### 4. Scalability & Performance
- Load balancing strategy
- Horizontal scaling approach
- Database sharding strategy
- CDN and edge computing considerations

### 5. Security & Privacy
- Authentication and authorization
- End-to-end encryption implementation
- Data privacy compliance (GDPR, etc.)
- Security threat analysis

### 6. Operational Considerations
- Monitoring and alerting
- Disaster recovery
- Backup strategies
- Deployment strategy

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Completeness**: All requirements addressed
- **Scalability**: Design can handle billions of users
- **Security**: Proper encryption and security measures
- **Performance**: Meets latency and throughput requirements
- **Clarity**: Clear, well-documented design
- **Realism**: Practical and implementable solution

## Resources
- Consider existing solutions: WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal
- Research messaging protocols: XMPP, MQTT, WebRTC
- Study distributed systems patterns
- Review encryption standards: Signal Protocol, Double Ratchet

## Submission Format
Submit your design as a comprehensive Markdown document with:
- Text descriptions of all components
- PlantUML or SVG diagrams for visual clarity
- Tables for data schemas and configurations
- Code examples for key algorithms (if applicable)
- References and research sources
